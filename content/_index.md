Welcome to Maker Arts! We're a Torbay based Community Interest Company set up to support young people who may be facing personal challenges attending mainstream education. Young people can take part in creative workshops, learn new skills, build on their confidence and discover employment opportunities in the art and STEM sectors that they may never have thought about. We use an holistic approach to help young people feel supported, gain knowledge and break down barriers that may be contributing to their disengagement from education.

We work with local businesses and expert mentors to give young people the skills and confidence for a career in art/STEM that may not have been clear to them before.
